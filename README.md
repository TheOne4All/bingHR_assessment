######### About bingHR_assessment #########

BingHR interview home assessment. A user should be able to perform a CRUD operation on the application. There is a 'Add User' button at the top corner; when clicked should display a modal, as seen in the second attached image.

We also have an Action column in the table where a user can click on the delete icon to delete a user and an edit icon where a user can click to display the second image but pre-fill with the user's info. At that point, the 'Add User' should be replaced with 'Update User'.
